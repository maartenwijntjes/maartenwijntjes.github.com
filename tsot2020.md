# The Skin of Things II - 'Appetizers!'

From 15 to 19 March 2021 we will have the second edition of The Skin of Things - a multidisciplinary gathering centered around the perception and depiction of materials. Just like many other conferences we will go on-line, with some regret as the previous Skin of Things was such a nice social event in and around the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. 

To accommodate this melancholia, we thought of something to make up. Besides being a stage to share (almost) finished work we also invite to share preliminary ideas and work. If you are willing to join and contribute to these 'Appetizers', we promise to organize the 'Main Dish' where we can reflect and discuss the results in person, when the time comes. 

Besides looking back and looking forward, we also look sideways; in which direction you will soon learn. In the oncoming months we will design the program and off course we would like to consider many different contributions. Below we'll explain the type of contributions and the daily themes. Do not let these themes prevent you from submitting, we can accomodate some
